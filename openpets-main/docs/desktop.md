# Desktop app

The desktop app (`apps/desktop/`) is the heart of OpenPets: the only long-lived
process, owner of all state, windows, the tray, pet rendering, the plugin
runtime, and the local IPC server that agents talk to. This doc explains its
process model, the major subsystems, and the rules that keep it secure and
stable. For the pet rendering specifics see [Pets](/pets); for the IPC wire
contract see [IPC and remote control](/ipc); for plugins see [Plugin platform](/plugins).

Source map: `apps/desktop/codemap.md` and `apps/desktop/src/codemap.md` are the
authoritative file-by-file maps. This doc is the narrative on top of them.

## Process model

Electron gives us a **main process** and multiple **renderer processes**. In
OpenPets:

- The **main process** (`src/main.ts` and the modules it orchestrates) holds all
  authority: state, lifecycle, tray, windows, IPC, leases, catalog/install,
  plugins, i18n.
- **Renderers** are sandboxed and powerless by default. Each gets a *narrow*
  preload bridge exposing only the APIs it needs:
  - The **Control Center** renderer (the React/Tailwind UI) via
    `control-center-preload.cjs`.
  - **Pet windows** (transparent, frameless, always-on-top) via `pet-preload.cjs`.
  - **Plugin JS hosts** and **plugin panels** via `plugin-sdk-preload.cjs`.

There is **no default main window**. The app is tray-first: tray actions open
the singleton Control Center routed to a specific page. A single-instance lock
(`app.requestSingleInstanceLock()`) focuses the existing instance instead of
launching a second one.

## Startup sequence

`main.ts` runs a deterministic bootstrap (see `src/codemap.md` for the exact
order): install lifecycle handlers → initialize app state → initialize the
logger → register the configured Talk shortcut → create the tray → start the
local IPC server → start the persisted, opt-in remote-control service if enabled
→ initialize and start the plugin service (with the Electron JS host) → construct
the host Pet Assistant service → optionally show the default pet. Shutdown
unregisters the exact shortcut before stopping voice, then stops the bounded Pet
Assistant turns before plugin teardown, remote-control listener, local IPC
server, and pet windows.

Key files: `main.ts` (entry/bootstrap), `lifecycle.ts` (app events + cleanup),
`state.ts` (shell pause flag).

## Linux display backend (Ozone/Wayland)

On Linux, `main.ts` appends `--ozone-platform=x11` **before** `app` is ready, so
the app always runs under x11/XWayland. This is required because OpenPets pets
depend on programmatic top-level window positioning (`setPosition`/`setBounds`)
and z-order control (`setAlwaysOnTop`); native Wayland forbids clients from
positioning or restacking their own toplevels, which silently breaks motion,
gravity, walkabout, drag, and always-on-top stacking. The forcing is
unconditional (it overrides even an explicit `--ozone-platform=wayland`) so a
mistaken launch flag cannot disable pet movement.

The escape hatch is the environment variable `OPENPETS_ALLOW_WAYLAND=1`: when
set, the app honors the system default backend (or an explicit
`--ozone-platform`) and emits a one-time `warn("app", ...)` at startup (after the
startup-begin log) stating that positioning, gravity, walkabout, and drag are
unsupported under native Wayland and how to restore full functionality. The
pet-drag path keys off this same effective backend via
`isEffectiveWaylandBackend()` in `pet-window.ts`, which is evaluated at
window-creation time (after the switch is applied) and cached. The pure backend
decision (platform + `--ozone-platform` + `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`)
is factored into `computeEffectiveWaylandBackend()` in `wayland-backend.ts`;
`pet-window.ts` delegates to it and owns only the cache.

The x11-forcing branch and the `OPENPETS_ALLOW_WAYLAND` opt-out are asserted by
`check-packaging-contract.ts`, so this behavior cannot silently regress.

On Windows, the shell silently strips `HWND_TOPMOST` from other windows when an
app enters fullscreen (browser video, games) and never restores it - and no
Electron event fires when it happens, so the `show`/`restore` re-assertions
never run and the pet stays buried until manually toggled. Pet windows
therefore re-assert always-on-top on a 1s interval while visible (the
shell's demotion sweep re-strips the flag every ~2-4s while a fullscreen app
is foreground, so the cadence bounds the buried time to under a second),
dropping
Electron's cached always-on-top flag first - Electron short-circuits
`setAlwaysOnTop(true)` when its cached state already matches, so without the
cache-bust the re-assert never reaches the OS
(`createBasePetWindow` in `pet-window.ts`); the call is a cheap no-op while the
flag is intact, and keeping the pet above fullscreen content matches the
explicit macOS `visibleOnFullScreen: true` behavior.

Separately, Chromium's native window occlusion tracker considers every window
on a display occluded while a fullscreen app is active there and stops
painting it - a transparent pet window goes blank even with its z-order
intact. `main.ts` disables `CalculateNativeWinOcclusion` on Windows so the
pet keeps rendering during fullscreen video and games.

## Subsystems

### Tray & windows

- `tray.ts` builds the tray icon (`assets.ts` loads `assets/tray-icon.png`,
  keeps it as a full-color image, and falls back to a generated icon if the
  asset is missing) and the context menu,
  including update status and route-targeted Control Center entries and a "open
  logs" action.
- `windows.ts` is the Control Center coordinator: it creates the hardened
  `BrowserWindow`, loads the Vite renderer (dev) or packaged `dist/renderer`
  (prod), targets a route, registers all renderer-facing IPC handlers, builds
  the Dashboard snapshot, and defines the internal asset protocols.
- `display.ts` provides screen-geometry helpers for positioning pet windows,
  including the permissive `clampToNearestDisplayIfOffscreen` helper that allows
  pets to roam across display seams while only snapping when fully off-screen.

### Control Center (renderer)

The React/Tailwind UI under `src/renderer/`. Pages: **Dashboard,
Pets, Integrations, Plugins, Settings** (the **Conversation** route is currently
internal/experimental and not exposed in Control Center navigation). It is a pure consumer of main-process
snapshots and actions exposed over the preload bridge - it holds no privileged
capability of its own. The renderer is the only "frontend" in scope for these
docs (the `web/` marketing site is out of scope). See
`src/renderer/src/codemap.md` for component structure.

Provider-profile bridge operations are exposed by
`control-center-preload.cjs` without a generic patch route: list profiles,
presets, role status, and derived realtime status; create/update/delete a
profile; select a profile independently for each role; update platform gates;
and set/check/delete a profile credential. Responses contain only credential
presence and header names. The Control Center Conversation surface consumes a
sanitized, host-owned current-session projection; it does not own assistant
state or the persisted archive. The projection retains only the most recent
200 display items. Separately, #149 provides a local-only atomic archive at
`userData/openpets-conversation-history.json`. It stores only terminal
user/assistant text from the canonical shared voice/chat conversation, retaining
at most 200 messages for 30 days and 512 KiB total, with a 64 KiB per-entry cap
and newest entries preserved. Corrupt or malformed archives are quarantined
when possible, replaced with an empty archive, and never partially trusted.
If archive storage is unavailable, history is disabled for that session without
blocking the Pet Assistant.
The archive is distinct from active in-memory context. Its prompt contribution
is the most recent 24 entries, bounded to 128 KiB; tool definitions/results,
provider payloads, and personality data are excluded. A narrow preload/main
bridge exposes list, delete-one, and delete-all only to the Conversation route.
Its separate **Local history** panel lets the owner open an archived message,
return to the active session, delete one entry, or confirm irreversible deletion
of all entries; it refreshes when the host becomes ready and after terminal
turns/deletions. No semantic retrieval, summary, preference, network
synchronization, or provider call is involved in archive reads or erasure.
Normalized voice transcript events remain an
integration seam for #147: their adapter must provide a process-lifetime
monotonic sequence within the voice source; voice ordering is deliberately
independent from the canonical assistant event sequence.
Provider updates use sparse patches: omitted fields preserve current values,
`null` clears `baseUrl`, `secretRef`, or `auth`, omitted `headers` preserves the
redacted header list, and `headers: []` intentionally clears it.

Talk controls are exposed through narrow preload methods (`getVoiceAssistantSnapshot`,
`startVoiceAssistant`, `muteVoiceAssistant`, `unmuteVoiceAssistant`,
`interruptVoiceAssistant`, `endVoiceAssistant`, and `onVoiceAssistantEvent`).
The shortcut accelerator is persisted in Settings and its runtime status and
reason are part of the authoritative Talk snapshot/event contract. Runtime
status is `registered`, `conflict`, `unavailable`, or `invalid`; registration and
unregistration failures are never presented as active, and a failed unregister
retains ownership so a replacement cannot create an untracked shortcut. The
default is the canonical `CommandOrControl+Shift+Space`. Replacing a preference
unregisters the exact previous accelerator before attempting the new one. Pet,
tray, and shortcut entry points all use one host-owned toggle (start when
inactive, end when active). The contract reports only host-observed session
state, not fabricated microphone device metadata. Ending voice releases
voice-only state while preserving the shared assistant conversation.
Canonical voice terminal feedback is held by `turnId` until synthesis and
playback settle, then applied once; late activity snapshots cannot overwrite
the settled result. The tray subscribes to the same authoritative Talk
snapshots so its Talk/End Talk label follows session transitions without
duplicating lifecycle state.
Typed chat and Talk share one host-owned modality lease for the current
conversation. A competing turn is rejected before capture or model work with
an actionable busy error; leases release on terminal settlement, end, or
shutdown. Terminal feedback is the only failure/missing-information trigger;
the latter is shown only when the structured capability boundary explicitly
declares `missingInformation: true`, including a missing required field at the
host-owned capability input validator.

### Pet windows

Pet rendering lives in `pet-window.ts` plus the two controllers
(`default-pet-controller.ts`, `agent-pet-controller.ts`) and the motion/mapping
helpers. This is covered in depth in [Pets](/pets).

### Local IPC server

`local-ipc.ts` runs a `net.Server` over a Unix socket / Windows named pipe /
TCP, routes a versioned JSON protocol, and writes a discovery file so clients
can find it. The lease manager (`lease-manager.ts`) sits behind it. Full
contract in [IPC and remote control](/ipc).

### Remote control service

`remote-control-service.ts` is deliberately not a mode of `local-ipc.ts`. It is
disabled unless a local caller explicitly configures a concrete private,
loopback, link-local, or CGNAT-range IPv4 address and port. Wildcards, public
addresses, hostnames, IPv6, non-canonical IPv4 text, and port zero are rejected.
Its own versioned protocol has a 4 KiB payload cap, bounded socket lifetime,
concurrent-socket cap, and per-remote-address rate limit. The absolute deadline
remains through response shutdown so half-open peers are reclaimed without
truncating a complete response.

Pairing creates a named client and a high-entropy token. The plaintext token is
returned only by the local pairing/rotation API; persistence stores only its
SHA-256 verifier plus client metadata and activity timestamps. The main-process
IPC interface (`openpets:remote-*`) supports Control Center management: configuration,
pairing, listing, rotation, and revocation. Control Center (Settings → Remote)
provides a dedicated UI with listener configuration, explicit IPv4 bind validation,
a prominent unencrypted TCP transport warning with explicit acknowledgement before
enabling, paired client listing with scope badges, pairing with `say` unchecked by default,
a one-time token handoff panel with environment/CLI setup guidance (`OPENPETS_REMOTE_ENDPOINT="tcp://<address>:<port>"` derived from active listener state), and confirmation
modals for token rotation and client revocation.

Remote requests can only read a sanitized status snapshot, react to the default pet,
or say a short validated message with the `say` scope. Leases, installation, discovery,
files, media, paths, prompts, tool output, and arbitrary pet targets are not part of the
remote capability. Explanatory copy in Control Center highlights these default-pet-only
and no-files/media constraints. LAN ownership is initialized before the remote service
singleton and Control Center handlers; the persisted listener starts only after the normal
UI/local-IPC startup steps. While LAN ownership is unknown or belongs to another host,
remote reactions and speech return `shown: false` instead of waking or forwarding the
local default pet. With LAN mode off, local default-pet behavior is unchanged.

**Pet fallback notification:** when an agent requests a specific pet via
`--pet <id>` and that pet is not installed (or is invalid/broken), the lease
manager silently falls back to the default pet and window confinement does not
activate. `pet-fallback-notify.ts` detects this condition and fires a native
macOS notification (once per unique pet ID) so the user knows why confinement
is inactive. The notification includes the command to use once the pet is
installed.

### App state

`app-state.ts` persists a versioned JSON document under
`userData/openpets-state.json` using atomic temp-write + rename. It holds
installed pets, the default-pet config, reaction→animation overrides, onboarding
state, locale preference, the pet pool preference (ordered pet list +
`petPoolEnabled` toggle), the host Pet Assistant personality profile, and display-roaming preferences (`petConfinementEnabled`,
`petCrossDisplayEnabled`), plus the global `waitingAnimationDurationMs`
preference and canonical `voiceAssistantShortcut` accelerator. That duration is normalized to `1010` ms (Normal) or `2200` ms
(Relaxed), with `1010` ms as the default. `app-state-core.ts` and
`pet-assistant-personality.ts` hold pure normalization helpers that are testable
without Electron.

#### Pet pool preference

The **pet pool** is an ordered list of installed pets plus a master enable/disable
toggle (`petPoolEnabled`, default `true`), both configurable in Control Center →
Settings → General. When enabled, the lease manager uses the ordered list to
assign a distinct pet to each concurrent agent session that does not explicitly
request one via `--pet <id>`. Slot 1 is the primary/default pet; slot 2 onwards
are assigned to additional sessions in order. When all pool slots are taken,
further sessions receive a random eligible pet (installed, non-broken, not the
built-in default). Slots free up when their session ends. `--pet <id>` bypasses
the pool entirely. When disabled, all sessions without `--pet` share the single
default pet (legacy behavior). Pool assignment is pure lease logic and works on
all platforms.

**Toggle side-effects:** disabling the pool immediately despawns all active pool
pets (releases their leases, which closes their windows). Re-enabling respawns a
pool pet for every session whose client PID is still alive - those sessions
acquire new leases and their windows reopen. Sessions whose processes have already
terminated are skipped. This is handled by `dispatchPoolToggle` in `local-ipc.ts`,
wired from the `update-preferences` IPC handler in `windows.ts`.

**Session teardown:** a periodic liveness sweep (the `local-ipc.ts` cleanup timer
calling `lease-manager.ts`'s `checkPidLiveness`) releases an agent pet's lease - and so closes its window - once the owning session is gone. It probes the
**terminal owner PID** (when known) as well as the client PID, so an orphaned but
still-running client can't keep a pet alive indefinitely. Expiring the 15s TTL is
the backstop; liveness is the prompt path.

See [Agent integrations](/agent-integrations) for the
full behavioral description.

### Plugin subsystem

A large, self-contained subsystem (`plugin-*.ts`) covering manifests, state,
runtime, the sandboxed JS host, the permission-checked SDK bridge, catalog/local
install, assets, panels, diagnostics, and platform settings. Fully documented in
[Plugin platform](/plugins) and [Plugin SDK v3](/sdk).

The plugin voice foundation is deliberately smaller than a conversation platform.
`voice-capture-electron.ts` owns a hidden, sandboxed microphone window and
isolated session; `voice-capture.ts` owns exactly-once cleanup and cancellation; and
`voice-privacy-indicator-electron.ts` shows the host-owned **OpenPets is listening**
surface only after `getUserMedia()` succeeds. A capture is one-shot and one-at-a-
time, with a 15-second acquisition timeout, a separate 30-second transcription
timeout, and an explicit host cancellation path. Plugin teardown and app shutdown
cancel the active capture, abort transcription, stop tracks, destroy the capture
window, clear its temporary session data, and hide the indicator. No ambient or
wake-word listening is implemented. While active, the existing tray menu exposes
**Stop microphone listening** during acquisition/recording and **Cancel
transcription** while provider transcription is pending; the control disappears
when the operation settles.

The private `VoiceConversationService` and hidden, sandboxed realtime renderer
remain host infrastructure. When the explicitly selected text profile uses the
native `openai-realtime` adapter, the Talk surface creates the optional
`OpenAIRealtimeVoiceAssistantSession`; other text profiles keep the generic
STT -> Pet Assistant -> TTS path. The realtime lane shares the microphone and
modality leases, tracks interruptions and mute state, rejects stale events, and
releases only its own resources on close. It never destroys the shared privacy
indicator; `voice-resource-owner.ts` performs final teardown after every lane
stops. The renderer owns `getUserMedia`, WebRTC, the data channel, and remote
audio. It emits only bounded normalized transcripts and tool-call requests; the
host keeps credentials, builds canonical tools, executes capabilities through
the Pet Assistant service, and encodes provider-specific results back to
Realtime. Response IDs and input item IDs remain attached through the normalized
event boundary so delayed events from an interrupted response cannot mutate the
replacement canonical turn. No plugin SDK route or plugin permission exposes
this adapter.

#### Generic host voice session and Talk controls (#147, #150)

`voice-assistant-host.ts` exposes a host controller/factory, not an app-lifetime
terminal session. Each activation creates one `VoiceAssistantSession`; ending it
releases the microphone reservation and the next activation creates a fresh
session. The composition is bounded final-only capture/transcription → canonical
Pet Assistant → authoritative TTS. Text, STT, and TTS provider profiles are
independent, with the STT profile snapshotted before capture begins. #150 adds
bounded host controls and a pet-owned Talk entry. Generic session transcript
events and the optional Realtime adapter are normalized
into the #148 current-session Conversation projection; terminal text is also
eligible for the #149 host archive, while voice lifecycle itself remains
host-owned. A single app-lifetime feedback reducer consumes typed and
voice canonical events plus listening and actual playback transitions. Canonical
`responding` remains thinking, speaking is emitted only after playback starts,
cancellation is not failure, and missing-information is shown only when the
canonical outcome explicitly marks it.

Pet-window playback is request-scoped by `{ requestId, kind }`. Renderer audio and
system speech settle replacement, matching/unscoped stop, error, close, renderer
loss, navigation, and timeout paths exactly once. Deadlines are bounded but
duration-aware: system speech accounts for the complete chunked text and speech
rate, while provider audio receives a generous allowance under the hard maximum.
System speech reports one completion only after the last chunk, preserving the
authoritative assistant text. Voice activity uses its own composable pet slot, so
voice animation/status cleanup cannot erase an unrelated plugin message, media
bubble, or status badge. It maps listening/thinking/acting/speaking to
waiting/thinking/working/running and clears the voice slot on mute, pause, end,
and shutdown.

#### Pet Assistant host integration (#138, #146)

Once `PluginService.start()` resolves, `pet-assistant-host.ts` constructs the
single host-owned `PetAssistantService`. `text-model-client.ts` uses a stable
operation snapshot from `provider-service.ts` for the selected text profile;
secret credential values are resolved from `PluginSecretsStore` and never enter
settings or snapshots; optional static provider header values remain in the
local provider-profile settings and snapshots expose only their names. The adapter never uses the
plugin `ctx.ai` gateway. Capability discovery and execution call the
generation-pinned `PluginService` APIs; pre-invocation lifecycle rejection is
unavailable, while a disable/reload after invocation is indeterminate.

The service keeps only bounded in-memory conversation state, validates whole
tool batches before side effects, bounds context/tool/final payloads, and
cancels active model/capability waits during idempotent shutdown. Missing model
configuration fails a turn clearly and does not prevent desktop startup. The
host injects a synchronous composition provider backed by `app-state.ts`.
`PetAssistantService` captures the returned profile at the beginning of each
turn, so Settings edits are visible to the next turn while an active turn keeps
one stable composition snapshot. The profile contains bounded `petName`, `tone`,
`style`, `ownerAddress`, and `responseLength` fields with neutral defaults.

The system prompt order is immutable host rules, optional curated context, and a
fixed-order JSON personality data block with escaped prompt markers. The
most-recent local archive window follows the system message and is bounded to
24 entries/128 KiB; active in-memory context remains a separate bounded layer.
The archive contains only terminal user/assistant text from the canonical shared
conversation. Tool definitions/results, provider payloads, and personality data
never enter it. The current structured capability definitions and authoritative
results remain provider-neutral tool data. Personality is explicitly
communication-only and cannot grant capabilities, change permissions, or
rewrite failed, rejected, unavailable, or indeterminate outcomes. When any
such non-completed outcome exists, the terminal response is a deterministic
host-generated status summary rather than model prose; all-completed turns
preserve the model response. The archive is local-only and atomic, with 200
messages/30 days/512 KiB retention and a 64 KiB per-entry cap; corrupt data is
quarantined/replaced. A narrow Control Center bridge permits only listing,
deleting one archived message, or clearing the archive; its local-history panel
is separate from the active session and updates after a terminal turn or owner
deletion. There is no semantic retrieval, summary, preference, network
synchronization, or provider call for archive reads. Provider-profile management
is implemented in the Control Center
through the host-owned bridge.

The plugin subsystem also owns **display deliveries**: a lazy, transparent,
host-owned surface used by `ctx.ui.delivery`. A delivery is rendered as a single
courier-and-banner surface on the cursor display, rather than as a spawned pet
or a plugin-controlled overlay. Each display advances a bounded FIFO queue;
expiry, dismissal, display removal, plugin reload/disable/uninstall, and app
shutdown are host lifecycle events. The host animates the declared courier strip
and owns its layout; plugins only supply a trusted sprite reference and text.

Calendar Airmail's configuration is a plugin-exclusive courier picker. It is an
accessible animated sprite grid whose selected/hovered/focused cards animate,
while reduced-motion users see a static first frame. It does not select, preview,
or validate installed pets; its bundled courier sprites remain available wherever
the plugin is installed.

### Agent setup

`agent-setup.ts` detects installed agents and runs configuration actions (MCP
add/replace/remove, hooks install/uninstall/doctor, memory file install),
delegating to the integration packages. It also owns the OpenClaw setup
boundary: the configured `openclaw` executable is used for version, list, and
inspect discovery, while install/update/enable/remove actions are run only for
the owned npm package and are verified by a post-action refresh. Nix mode,
unsupported hosts/versions, nonstandard plugin ownership, invalid metadata, and
failed refreshes remain explicit status states rather than being auto-mutated.
`claude-memory.ts` manages the Claude instructions file. The Control Center
consumes the setup snapshot and actions through `windows.ts`; the CLI's global
`configure --agent openclaw` flow uses the same OpenClaw management contract but
does not use a project path or pet selection. See [Agent integrations](/agent-integrations).

### Catalog & installation

`catalog.ts` fetches the pet catalog (v3 paginated, with v2/fixture fallback);
`pet-installation.ts` downloads + validates + extracts pet ZIPs; `codex-pets.ts`
imports locally-developed pets. See [Catalogs](/catalog) and [Pets](/pets).

### i18n

`src/i18n/` resolves the active locale and serves localized host UI text and pet
reaction speech, with English fallback. See [Internationalization](/i18n).

### Updates

`update-checker.ts` polls GitHub releases and surfaces update status to the tray
and Dashboard; `update-version.ts` does version parsing/comparison.

### Logging

`logger.ts` provides scoped, structured logging (scopes: `app`, `ipc`, `lease`,
`pet.*`, `state`, `tray`, `ui`) with log rotation (~2MB) and redaction of
sensitive data, written to `userData/logs/openpets.log`. Renderer diagnostics
should be routed here so failures are visible in the log file, not only DevTools
(see the logging guidance in `AGENTS.md`).

## Security model

This is non-negotiable surface area. The app handles remote content (catalogs,
ZIPs) and runs third-party plugin code, so it is defensive by construction:

- **Sandboxed renderers** with `contextIsolation`; capabilities reach them only
  through narrow `contextBridge` preload APIs.
- **Strict CSP**: `default-src 'none'`, inline styles only. Any new
  renderer-visible URL scheme, image source, dev endpoint, or internal protocol
  **must** be added to the CSP in *both* `apps/desktop/vite.config.ts` and
  `apps/desktop/src/renderer/index.html`. Common pet image protocols:
  `openpets-codex:`, `openpets-installed:`, `openpets-pet-preview:`, and
  `openpets-plugin-asset:`. Forgetting the CSP makes images fall back to the
  default pet even when install/render logic is correct. (This is a documented,
  easy-to-hit footgun in `AGENTS.md`.)
- **Pet-window media CSP**: both HTML documents generated by
  `createBuiltInPetRender` and `createInstalledPetRender` allow imported and
  synthesized audio data URLs through the sole media exemption, `media-src
  data:`. They do not allow file or network media sources.
- **Mock keychain** to avoid OS credential prompts.
- **IPC network security**: local TCP mode is restricted to loopback/private
  addresses; public IPs and hostnames are rejected. Remote control is separate,
  opt-in, explicitly bound, authenticated per client, and scope limited; it
  never writes a discovery file. See [IPC and remote control](/ipc).
- **Defensive I/O**: atomic writes everywhere; path-traversal and symlink checks
  on every filesystem boundary; strict ZIP entry validation (`zip-safety.ts`).
- **Plugin sandbox**: plugins run in hidden, session-partitioned BrowserWindows
  with navigation/window-open hardening and permission-gated SDK calls. See
  [Plugin platform](/plugins).

- **Trusted plugin assets**: `openpets-plugin-asset:` serves only an enabled,
  exact-version JavaScript plugin's declared sprite. The protocol accepts only a
  narrow sprite route, resolves it beneath the real install root, rechecks WebP
  dimensions against manifest frame metadata, and returns no filesystem paths to
  a renderer. Delivery documents have their own restrictive CSP and can load
  only this protocol (or data URLs).

## Packaging

`electron-builder.yml` configures cross-platform packaging (macOS/Windows/Linux)
with ASAR. Bundled mode unpacks the integration binaries from ASAR so hooks/MCP
can spawn them. `scripts/release-local.mjs` automates a macOS-local release with
a GitHub draft. See [Development](/development) for the release flow.
